GeographicFileParser

This library has the intention of parsing KML or KMZ files to extract certain configured tags from the input file.

Usage:
Intended usage can be seen in Example.java, but basically instantiate a parser object passing the input file as a parameter
and then call the method parse().

Test:
Simply drop KMZ/KML files to the Examples folder and run Example.java.

TODO:
Specify tags.
